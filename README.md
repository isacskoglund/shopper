# Shopper

This project is WIP and not complete.

## Description

Ecommerce backend as microservices.

### Stack

All services are currently being built Python and Django. This could change on a per-service basis.

### Anticipated platform

Google Cloud Platform, utilizing PubSub, Redis and PostgresSQL.

### Hobby project

This is personal hobby project that I build on my own during my free time.
The goal is improve my skills in software engineering and system design. At the same time, I want to create a fully functional, scalable and manageable product that can be develop and used reliably. I try to consistently implement industry best practices and standard coding conventions to produce code of as high quality as possible. I also strive to follow common design patterns such as Hexagonal Architecture and Microservices. With that said, I am yet a hobbyist and there is often room for improvement.

## Updates

I try to update all the READMEs in this project as I progress.
